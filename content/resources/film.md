- [Citizenfour](https://citizenfourfilm.com/) - Citizenfour is unique in that it is not just a documentary about Edward Snowden and the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures but was partly filmed during Snowden's first contact with journalists. I highly recommend this.
- [United States of Secrets](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/united-states-of-secrets/) - This is a 2 part documentary series that explores the massive and controversial secret surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the impact it had on the American public.
- [Weapons of Mass Surveillance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7055384/) - A great BBC documentary on how Middle Eastern autocracies use and abuse spyware and surveillance technology and how western technology corporations and governments are complicit.
- [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) 
- [Why Privacy Matters | Glenn Greenwald at TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk) - A brilliant TED talk from one of the journalists who worked with Snowden to blow the whistle on mass surveillance.
- [The Power of Privacy | The Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGX-c5BJNFk) A short film on why privacy matters from the institution that started the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures.
- [Safe and Sorry â€“ Terrorism & Mass Surveillance | Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_PjdU3Mpo) - A visually stunning and highly informative 6 minute video on the debate between privacy and security.
