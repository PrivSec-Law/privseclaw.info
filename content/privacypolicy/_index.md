## Data Processing

I take your privacy very seriously. This site has no analytics enabled. 

I do not collect, store, or otherwise process your personal data unless you choose to contact me directly (e.g., by email, calling, or through messaging applications). In such cases, I will ensure that processing of your personal data is done in accordance with the principles of data protection by design and default, ensuring that data is:

- Collected for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes.  
- Processed in a manner that is fair, transparent, and secure.  
- Kept accurate, complete, and up-to-date.  
- Stored for no longer than necessary.  
- Deleted or anonymized when no longer needed.  

By default, this site does not set non-essential cookies.  

Certain features on this site rely on third-party services. These are only activated if you choose to interact with them:

- **YouTube videos**: Videos are embedded using a privacy-enhanced setup and only load once you actively click “Play.” At that point, your browser will connect to YouTube, which may set cookies or collect usage data. See [YouTube’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).  
- **Substack email signup**: If you use the signup form to subscribe, your information will be sent directly to Substack. See [Substack’s Privacy Policy](https://substack.com/privacy).  

If you do not wish to share information with these third parties, you can simply choose not to interact with these elements.
